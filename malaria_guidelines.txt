CLINICAL GUIDELINES FOR MALARIA (2025 EDITION)

1. DIAGNOSIS
- The Gold Standard for diagnosis is Microscopic Examination of thick and thin blood films.
- Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) detecting HRP2 antigen are recommended where microscopy is unavailable.
- PCR is used for species confirmation but is not for initial treatment decisions.

2. UNCOMPLICATED MALARIA TREATMENT (P. falciparum)
- First-line: Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT).
- Preferred option: Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL) for 3 days.
- Dosage: 4 tablets twice daily for adults (>35kg).
- Alternative: Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AS-AQ).

3. SEVERE MALARIA TREATMENT
- Immediate hospitalization is required.
- First-line: Intravenous (IV) Artesunate (2.4 mg/kg) at 0, 12, and 24 hours.
- If IV Artesunate is unavailable, use IM Artemether.
- Follow up with a full 3-day course of oral ACT once the patient can tolerate oral medication.

4. PREGNANCY
- First Trimester: Quinine + Clindamycin is preferred.
- Second/Third Trimester: Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL) is safe.
- Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPTp) with SP is recommended from the 2nd trimester.
